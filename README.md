# Godot Game
This is just a small game I'm trying to do on Godot by myself without relying (too much) on YouTube tutorials.<br/>
It was going to be set in space but I've changed it (to a 'toy-tank' scenario) and now I'm too scared to rename the repository and mess everything up, so it'll stay that way.
